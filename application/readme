To run the application successfully, make sure the trained models are saved in the following structure:

application/
├── application/                    # Main app code
├── svm/
│   └── svm_model.pkl              # Trained SVM model (~5.8 GB)
└── cnn/
    └── cnn_disease_model.pth     # Trained CNN model (~8 MB)

Ensure svm_model.pkl and cnn_disease_model.pth are placed exactly in the svm/ and cnn/ folders respectively.

The application will fail to load models if they are missing or incorrectly placed.
